# Glossary

This glossary is intended to be a comprehensive and standardized list of the signare terminology.

## Account
An account in Ethereum refers to an entity that can send and receive transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. Each account is identified by a unique address and can hold ether (the cryptocurrency of Ethereum). Externally owned accounts (EOAs) are controlled by private keys.

## Transaction
A transaction in Ethereum represents a unit of value exchange or interaction with the Ethereum blockchain. It typically involves transferring ether between accounts or invoking a smart contract's function. Each transaction includes essential information such as the sender's address, recipient's address (if applicable), amount of ether transferred, and optional data payload. Transactions must be digitally signed by the sender's private key to be valid.

## Signature
In Ethereum, a signature is a cryptographic proof of authorization associated with a transaction or message. It is generated using the sender's private key and verifies the authenticity and integrity of the associated data. 

## Module
A module in the context of a Hardware Security Module (HSM) refers to a physical or logical component that performs specific cryptographic functions or operations. HSMs consist of various components designed to handle tasks such as key generation, encryption, decryption, and digital signatures. 

## Slot
In the context of a Hardware Security Module (HSM), a slot is a logical container within the HSM used for storing cryptographic keys and performing cryptographic operations.

## Application
The signare is a multitenant application that is intended to serve to multiple tenants, these tenants receive the name of applications in our domain.
An application serve as logical containers within the configuration. It encapsulates all necessary information for users to operate under them.
