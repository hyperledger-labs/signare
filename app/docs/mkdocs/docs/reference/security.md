# Security 

This document provides an overview of controlling access to the signare REST API and JSON RPC API.

The target audience of this document is a user that wants to know more about the architecture of the application.

Out of the scope of this guide are explanations about how to configure an external authentication layer.

## Introduction

Before diving into the security architecture of the application, it is very important to differentiate between two crucial concepts: 

- **Authentication**: Verifies the identity of a client.
    - Answers the question *"Who are you?"*
    - Examples: passwords, biometrics, certificates...

- **Authorization**: Controls actions permitted for authenticated entities.
    - Answers the question *"What are you allowed to do?"*
    - Access based on permissions or roles.

## Authentication

The signare relies on external authentication systems in order to support integration with the clientâ€™s chosen authentication mechanism. 
The authentication system provides an extensible way to collect user and application data to contextualize the requests.

The diagram below displays a `security gateway` as an abstraction of the security layer that provides authentication (either service, commercial or custom):

## Authorization

Users access the signare by making HTTP requests to its APIs. When a request reaches the API, the middleware have to authorize the access. 
The diagram below illustrates the authorization process:

   Client -> Middleware:  Request(authorization headers)
   Middleware -> App: Check headers
   App -> App: Check user's authorization
   App -> Middleware: Response(user's authorization)
   Middleware -> App: Accept request
   App -> Client: Response

The table below describes the authorization header keys for every request: 

| Name                     | Value type | Description                           |
|--------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------|
| **X-Auth-UserId**        | string     | ID of the signare's user        |
| **X-Auth-ApplicationId** | string     | ID of the signare's application |

!!! note 
    Not all API endpoints require the `X-Auth-ApplicationId` header keys, that information depends on the role based access configuration of the signare.

Once an HTTP request reaches the signare as described in the step 1, the authorization process continues as follows:

1. In the step 2 the middleware validates if the header keys are present in the user's HTTP request.
2. In the steps 3 the middleware validates if the [configuration of the Role Based Access Control (RBAC)](rbac.md) authorizes user to perform the request.
3. In the steps 5 the middleware authorizes the user's request and then delivers it to the business logic layer.

!!! note
    If the middleware does not authorize the request, the server will respond with a `403` HTTP status code.
